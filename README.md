# Breast-Cancer-Prediction

I have extracted features of breast cancer patient cells and normal person cells then I’m create
an ML model to classify malignant and benign tumor. To complete this ML project we are using
the supervised machine learning classifier algorithm, Also, my model prediction score is 96%, which indicated good score . 
Now I’m thinking to develop some frontend part of this project.
